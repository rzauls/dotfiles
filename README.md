# Dotfiles

This is where I store the dotfiles that I might possibly at some point reuse somewhere.

- There will no support provided if someone for some reason wants to use these (other than myself).
- This has no guarantee to work on any other systems than my own.

## Usage

- Clone this repository into somewhere
- Run `make stow` and hope for the best

## Why

- Using `stow` makes me not have to worry about where the files should be linked to
- Using this repo enables me to share configuration between devices
